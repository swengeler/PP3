Slide with problems to be solved, dont spent much time on it

Good structure

Scientific setup on the report is good

Flowchart of greedy bigger?
it is wrong! (neverending)

Stick with one representation (Pseudocode ! Flowchart)

High level abstraction of flowchart

Presentation should follow speech?!?!

Stay in 20 minutes!

Scientific structre in presentation also good

Difference Hillclimbing and Greedy?

Remark own 3D representation

Talk to jan about Genetic algorithm


Report:

one of the best.
State all 4 problems in introduction
Mention existing approaches we use adapt and motivate why

Same type of representation(Flowchart, Pseudocode)

Important to give it (not only text)

Chapter: Implementation and System provide uml diagramm
Section about the system "user guide" and information about the parameters

Provide experiments for all assignments in chapter experiments
Explain settings for experiments, so that they can be repeated

Seperate chapter/section provide interpretation and discuss results (lower level)
and additional high level conclusion at the end

References!
